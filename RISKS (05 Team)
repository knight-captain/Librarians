  //Data input: RFID 
    //Camera permissions

//Lookup ISBN 
    //API's
    //web crawler, if API's don't give us the info we need
  Mitigate: CAptain will look into this more: Goodreads disabled their API, but other sources exist 


//Database
    //Cloud? (sharable?)
    //on device (it's mostly going to be Strings, so maybe?)
